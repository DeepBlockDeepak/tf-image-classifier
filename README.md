# TF Image Classifier

TF Image Classifier is a showcase of my image classification skills using TensorFlow. This project serves as an exercise in deploying ML systems to production environments.

## Project Goals:
- Demonstrate proficiency in deploying machine learning systems to real-world production settings.
- Emphasize the packaging of ML software for ease of use and maintainability.


## Quick Start

### Example Run (from project root):
Run the classifier with the following command:
`python scripts/image_classifier_write_to_json.py models/model_b7 images/stella_boston_terrier.jpg`


### Testing

To run the entire test suite, use the command:
`python -m unittest discover tests`

For a single test:
`python -m unittest tests/test_image_classification.py`
